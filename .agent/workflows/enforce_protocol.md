# 🛡️ Protocol Enforcement Workflow

This workflow ensures the agent adheres to the "DocTranslation Supreme Master Protocol".

## 1. Context Loading [CRITICAL]

Run the following command to load the "Active Context" and "Prime Directive".

```bash
# View the Prime Directive (Read-Only)
type .agent\rules\GLOBAL_RULES.md
```

## 2. Language Check

- **Current Policy**: **Korean First (한국어 우선)**
- **Verification**:
  - Are you thinking in Korean? (Mental check)
  - Are you planning to write the final response in Korean?
  - Are code comments in Korean?

## 3. Persona Activation

Identify the active agent for the current task:

- **@PM**: Managing tasks?
- **@Architect**: Designing systems?
- **@Builder**: Writing code?
- **@Guardian**: Security/Payment?

## 4. Output Commit

I solemnly swear to:

1. **Speak Korean**.
2. **Use the Agent Report Format**.
3. **Update `task.md`**.

**Run this mental check before every response.**
